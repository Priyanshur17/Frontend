# iNotebook Backend

This repository contains the code for backend of iNotebook app using MERN stack etc. The project contains Schema for storing data into databases, API endpoints, routes & all other parts which are required and necessary for building a backend of an application.

## Features

- Backend Database: The backend of iNotebook is linked with MongoDB Atlas to store & fetch data, fast and secure.
- Hashing: By means of hashing, your passwords are end-to-end encrypted and cannot be viewed, hacked or shared. 
- Authenticator - By the use of JSON Web Token, chances of phishing are minimized & user info is limited to that specific user only.
- API Calls: By using the API calls at the endpoints of Host URL, you can get or put your data from database.
